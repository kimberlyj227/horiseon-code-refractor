# horiseon-code-refractor

#Horiseon Website

The goal of this project was to take the existing code and make it more accessible for the client. I added semantic HTML tags, created alt tags for all images, added a title, and made sure the HTML and CSS code followed a logical order. I also gave meaning classes to elements to consolidate the CSS code.
